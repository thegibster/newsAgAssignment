Web Optimization Andrew Gibbs

Removed variables header and HeaderTitles from app.js after console logging there results when the parent function was run due to repitative code calls and javascript lag from the timeline.

Moved all javascript to the botton of page and inlined all the css to prevent blocking.



*** Wanted to use web workers for the Ajax calls to have asynchonous functionalyity, however the implementation is still taking a while to understand . ***

Did not use build tools.
